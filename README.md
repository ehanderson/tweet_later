Tweet Later was created after we had been at Dev Bootcamp for a single month. 

Purpose:
  Create an application taht allows a user to sign in via Oauth from Twitter and send a tweet. 
  After that can be accomplished, set Sidekiq/ Redis-based queue, worker to send at a scheduled time. 
  Deploy to Heroku
  
Experience:
  Oauth from Twitter - understanding keys and secrets
  Sidkiq gem
  Redis gem
  Heroku
  Github
  
  
Learning gitflow and proper code to commit was just being introduced at this time. Obviously, this would be
a good project to go back and refactor in the future, but for now, it is a good representation of our learning 
process.
